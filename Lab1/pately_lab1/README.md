For Task 4, my main goal was to reduce the size of both the root filesystem (rootfs.img) and the kernel image (zImage) while keeping the system functional and meeting all assignment requirements. I began by optimizing BusyBox, which provides the majority of user-space utilities. Using `make menuconfig`, I disabled entire groups of unnecessary applets such as networking tools, system logging utilities (syslogd, klogd), mail utilities, and archiving tools like tar and gzip. I kept only the commands required by the assignment (ps, ls, pwd, cp, mv, etc.) and cron to run recurring tasks. After this step, the BusyBox binary became significantly smaller, reducing the actual used space inside the rootfs from over 100 MB to just 25 MB.

Next, I adjusted my rebuild script to allocate a smaller ext4 image file, reducing its size from 128 MB to 28 MB, which provided a small buffer above the 25 MB used by the root filesystem. This step reduced the rootfs.img file size from 134 MB to just 28 MB, a nearly 80% improvement. After these changes, the root filesystem still contained everything required for booting, running cron jobs, and executing the custom letters program.

To further reduce size, I carefully trimmed kernel configuration options. I removed networking support, cryptographic APIs, and many unused device drivers, including GPIO, HID, LEDs, misc devices, and SCSI. I also removed the Beaglebone pinmux helper since no I/O pins were needed for this QEMU-based assignment. These changes brought the kernel image down from 10.67 MB to 5.26 MB.

During optimization, I accidentally disabled critical kernel features, which caused boot failures. At one point, the system would not display any terminal output. I fixed this by re-enabling TTY and serial console support under Device Drivers → Character Devices → Serial Drivers → ARM AMBA PL011, which is required for QEMU to provide console output. Another major issue occurred when I disabled hardware floating-point (VFP) support. Since my BusyBox and user-space binaries were compiled with a hard-float toolchain (`arm-linux-gnueabihf-`), they required VFP instructions. Without this feature, `/sbin/init` crashed immediately with a SIGILL, causing a kernel panic. Re-enabling CONFIG\_VFP and CONFIG\_NEON fixed this issue and allowed the system to boot normally again.

In the final build, my rootfs.img size was 28 MB, and my zImage size was 5.34 MB. The cron job runs properly, starting one minute after boot and printing the required message every 10 seconds by looping internally within a single cron run. Through iterative debugging and careful trimming of BusyBox and kernel options, I successfully minimized the system while keeping it fully functional.
